# Principal Coordinates Analysis and 3D graph generation (PCoA 3D)

In this section, you can find the scripts and input data for a 3D PCoA generation.

> This repository contains data and instructions to run scripts used in different analyses of *Brachypodium stacei* data included in the paper:

> "Repeated migration, interbreeding, and bottlenecking  shaped the phylogeography and niche adaptation of the ancestral selfing Mediterranean grass *Brachypodium stacei*" by Miguel Campos Cáceres.

> And co-authored by Ernesto Pérez-Collazos, Antonio Díaz-Pérez, Diana López-Alvarez, Luis Mur, John Vogel and Pilar Catalán. 

## PCoA 3D
In order to generate the PCoA 3D graph we need 3 files: 
- `Stacei_Final.vcf` that contains the genomic data for the PCoA.
- `PCoAscores_mod.csv` coordinates obtained in the script and manually modified to add colors.
- `PCoA.R` is the main script to obtain and graph the PCoA 3D in R.
